# Helloo👋
I'm new to GitHub, but I'm not new to coding. I started coding ~1–2 months ago, so I might already know some languages.
Let me know if you guys have any tips, feedback, or interesting projects to collaborate on!  

## About Me
- Currently exploring Python, JavaScript, and other languages.  
- Always experimenting with small projects to learn new concepts.  
- Open to learning and trying new things in programming.  

## What’s in this Repo
- Simple scripts and projects I’ve been working on.  
- Experimentation with different coding challenges.  
- Anything fun or educational that I create along the way.  

## Connect with Me
Feel free to leave comments, issues, or suggestions.  
I’m excited to share my coding journey and learn from this amazing community!
